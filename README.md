# clfffn - DIRECTORY() replacement for CA-Clipper

This repository contains code for three functions that provide an
alternative to using CA-Clipper's `DIRECTORY()` function. I originally put
this little library together after a `comp.lang.clipper` discussion about
the array size limit in CA-Clipper and how this affects how many files you
can process using DIRECTORY().
